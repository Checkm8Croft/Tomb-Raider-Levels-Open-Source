# Tomb-Raider-Levels-Open-Source
Collection of PRJ files of classic tomb raiders that can be modfied as you want with modern editors

On raw folder there are extracted prj files of the levels with no modifications, so some textures will be mismatched or totally missing and objects (such as doors, enemies, medipacks, ammonitions, ...) are missing, so you have to reput them using level's wad

On complete folder there are prj2 files of the levels modified by me, so textures are adjusted (not perfectly as the original game but I fixed the missing them) and there are the objects and triggers. Now may somebody of you can notice that brightness of certain rooms, the  some texture positions and some triggers aren't as the original game :\, I copied object positions and triggers from [TRView](https://github.com/chreden/trview), but brightness and texture positions I made as better I can. If you want to edit them for make them better that me (so adjusted better), feel free to make a pull request :)

# See STATUS.MD for levels status and see what is not working or missing

# See NAMES.md for know what name has the filename (such as boat.tr2) respect of it real name (for example: boat.tr2 is Venice level)
